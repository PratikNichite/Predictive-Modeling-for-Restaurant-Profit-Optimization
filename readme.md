# Predictive Modeling for Restaurant Profit Optimization

## Problem Statement

- This project involves predicting restaurant profits based on city populations.
- As the CEO of a restaurant franchise, you are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
- The goal is to use linear regression to analyze existing data on city populations and restaurant profits to determine which cities may yield higher returns.
